            <h1>About the Podcast</h1><br>
            <p>Back in 2013, in a certain corner of the Internet, a fanfic called Designations Congruent With Things became wildly popular. The writer went by the username “CleanWhiteRoom,” and revealed nothing about their real life. Designations grew into spinoffs, an audiobook, a radio play, and a band with two albums—until one day, when CWR took it all down and disappeared. <br><br>Five years later, isolated by COVID, friends Sasha and Leo embark on a quest to find the long-lost writer. Along the way they hope to discover what makes their work unique, what makes fanfic special to so many people -- and finally, who was CWR, and what happened to them?</p>
